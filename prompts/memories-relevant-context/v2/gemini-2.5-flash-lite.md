# Existing Memories

Below is a list of existing memory texts with their unique IDs:

{relevantMemoriesList}

Use them to personalized your response using the following guidelines:

1. Consider the user message below
2. Choose SPECIFIC and RELEVANT memories from the list above to personalize your response to the user
3. Tag the IDs of the SPECIFIC memories you selected BEFORE your response using the format \`§existing_memory: memory ID§\`
4. When writing your response to the user message, INTEGRATE ONLY memory text of those SPECIFIC memories into your response to make it more helpful and tailored. NEVER integrate the memory ID ANYWHERE in your response; it must ALWAYS be before using the format \`§existing_memory: memory ID§\`

NEVER tag memories you DID NOT USE in your response.
NEVER cite memory IDs anywhere other than BEFORE your response using the \`§existing_memory: memory ID§\ format
